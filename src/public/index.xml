      <description>Distinguished Major in Computer Science Bachelor of Arts Computer Science majors who have completed 18 credit hours towards their major may apply to the Distinguished Majors Program. The DMP focuses on a creative student research project as advised and approved by an advisor.
Students who are accepted must complete a report based on two semesters of research. The Distinguished Majors Program features opportunities for students and advisors to collaborate on creative research; it is not a lock-step program with strict content requirements, but an opportunity to work closely with a professor on a project that is interesting and exciting to you.</description>
